/*
 * The bpf_{map,prog}_def structures are compiled for different architectures.
 * Once by the BPF compiler for the BPF architecture, and once by a C++
 * compiler for the native Android architecture for the bpfloader.
 *
 * For things to work, their layout must be the same between the two.
 * The BPF architecture is platform independent ('64-bit LSB bpf').
 * So this effectively means these structures must be the same layout
 * on 5 architectures, all of them little endian:
 *   64-bit BPF, x86_64, arm  and  32-bit x86 and arm
 *
 * As such for any types we use inside of these structs we must make sure that
 * the size and alignment are the same, so the same amount of padding is used.
 *
 * Currently we only use: bool, enum bpf_map_type and unsigned int.
 * Additionally we use char for padding.
 *
 * !!! WARNING: HERE BE DRAGONS !!!
 *
 * Be particularly careful with 64-bit integers.
 * You will need to manually override their alignment to 8 bytes.
 *
 * To quote some parts of https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69560
 *
 * Some types have weaker alignment requirements when they are structure members.
 *
 * unsigned long long on x86 is such a type.
 *
 * C distinguishes C11 _Alignof (the minimum alignment the type is guaranteed
 * to have in all contexts, so 4, see min_align_of_type) from GNU C __alignof
 * (the normal alignment of the type, so 8).
 *
 * alignof / _Alignof == minimum alignment required by target ABI
 * __alignof / __alignof__ == preferred alignment
 *
 * When in a struct, apparently the minimum alignment is used.
